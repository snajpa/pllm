At IP address 37.205.14.209, there is a machine called RemoteUbuDesktop.

It is a vpsFree.cz VPS running on a vpsAdminOS node. As it comes from the original vpsFree templates, which are just bare bones SSH to root and nothing else, we have some work to do.

I have uploaded my SSH key to root's authorized keys, so you can reach it at root@37.205.14.209.

I would like you to help me setup a remote desktop with default ubuntu desktop experience available via RDP.

I've read a Reddit post that said remote desktop could enabled via CLI in this fashion:

```
export GRDCERTDIR=~/.cert
mkdir -p ${GRDCERTDIR}
openssl genrsa -out ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key 4096
openssl req -new -key ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key -out ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.csr -subj "/C=DE/ST=Private/L=Home/O=Family/OU=IT Department/CN=ubuntu-live"
openssl x509 -req -days 100000 -signkey ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key -in ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.csr -out ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.crt
# Now the actual enable process: 
grdctl rdp enable
grdctl rdp set-credentials $USER $PASSWORD
# more on the $PASSWORD later
grdctl rdp disable-view-only
grdctl rdp set-tls-cert ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.crt
grdctl rdp set-tls-key ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key
systemctl --user enable gnome-remote-desktop.service
systemctl --user restart gnome-remote-desktop.service
```

As I said, it's a minimal installation with only a root user. You need to install all of what that Reddit post mentioned too, along the full Ubuntu desktop.

I would like you to set up an ordinary user for me, called snajpa with password snajpaDesktop123

Thank you!
