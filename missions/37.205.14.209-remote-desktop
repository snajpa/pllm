At IP address 37.205.14.209, there is a machine called RemoteUbuDesktop.

It is a vpsFree.cz VPS running on a vpsAdminOS node. As it comes from the original vpsFree templates, which are just bare bones SSH to root and nothing else, we have some work to do.

I have uploaded my SSH key to root's authorized keys, so you can reach the machine via ssh root@37.205.14.209.

Make sure you only work on that RemoteUbuDesktop machine, your session starts on a localhost which isn't the same machine.

I would like you to help me setup a remote desktop with default ubuntu desktop experience available via RDP.

I've read a Reddit post that said remote desktop could enabled via CLI in this fashion:

```bash
export GRDCERTDIR=~/.cert
mkdir -p ${GRDCERTDIR}
openssl genrsa -out ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key 4096
openssl req -new -key ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key -out ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.csr -subj "/C=DE/ST=Private/L=Home/O=Family/OU=IT Department/CN=ubuntu-live"
openssl x509 -req -days 100000 -signkey ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key -in ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.csr -out ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.crt
# Now the actual enable process: 
grdctl rdp enable
grdctl rdp set-credentials $USER $PASSWORD
# more on the $PASSWORD later
grdctl rdp disable-view-only
grdctl rdp set-tls-cert ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.crt
grdctl rdp set-tls-key ${GRDCERTDIR}/grd-tls.key
systemctl --user enable gnome-remote-desktop.service
systemctl --user restart gnome-remote-desktop.service
```

From what I've tried, it would seem that the desktop needs to be installed and running. So install the packages first, create the user, then reboot it and only then continue with su - snajpa.

As I said, it's a minimal installation with only a root user. You need to install all of what that Reddit post mentioned too, along the full Ubuntu desktop.

I would like you to set up an ordinary user for me, called snajpa, password PazzWeierdoz213

I would like to access the remote desktop via this snajpa user. Also add the user to the wheel group, it should be allowed to use sudo.

Please ensure that the configuration we do is persistent and all the desktopy stuff starts on boot.
