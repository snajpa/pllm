At IP address 37.205.14.209, there is a machine called RemoteUbuDesktop.

It is a vpsFree.cz VPS running on a vpsAdminOS node. As it comes from the original vpsFree templates, which are just bare bones SSH to root and nothing else, we have some work to do.

I have uploaded my SSH key to root's authorized keys, so you can reach the machine via ssh root@37.205.14.209.

Make sure you only work on that RemoteUbuDesktop machine, your session starts on a localhost which isn't the same machine.

I would like you to help me setup a WordPress blog on this machine.

It's Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, there's nothing except the base minimal installation.

I would like you to install the latest WordPress from Ubuntu repositories.

I would like the admin user to have the username admin and password admin123changelater

The blog should be accessible via domain blog.snajpa.net, which should be added to /etc/hosts as it's setup in DNS yet, I will do that later.

Please enable HTTPS on the blog using Let's Encrypt.

The mission is complete when there's a working installation of WordPress on https://blog.snajpa.net
