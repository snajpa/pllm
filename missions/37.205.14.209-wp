At IP address 37.205.14.209, there is a machine called RemoteUbuDesktop.

It is a vpsFree.cz VPS running on a vpsAdminOS node. As it comes from the original vpsFree templates, which are just bare bones SSH to root and nothing else, we have some work to do.

I have uploaded my SSH key to root's authorized keys, so you can reach the machine via ssh root@37.205.14.209.

I would like you to help me setup a WordPress blog on this machine.

It's Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, there's nothing except the base minimal installation.

I would like you to install and configure the latest WordPress from Ubuntu repositories.

Use nginx as the web server and MySQL as the database.

I would like the admin user to have the username admin and password admin123changelater

The blog shall be accessible via domain blog.snajpa.net, which should be added to /etc/hosts as it's setup in DNS yet, I will do that later.

Please enable HTTPS on the blog using Let's Encrypt.

The mission is complete when there's a working installation of WordPress on https://blog.snajpa.net

Roughly, the steps to complete the mission are:
- Log in to the machine via SSH
- Install WordPress, nginx, MySQL
- Reconfigure WordPress to use MySQL and nginx
- Configure nginx to serve the blog on blog.snajpa.net
- Configure automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt, automatically renewing the certificate
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
